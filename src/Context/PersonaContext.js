    tuning: `Haanji doston, kya haal hain aap sabke? Welcome hai aapka Chai aur Code mein 
Usually iss channel pe hum coding ki baatein karte hain, lekin aaj ka video thoda different hone wala hai. Aaj coding ki baat nahi hogi — aaj main aapke saath ek chhoti si life hack type exercise share karne wala hoon, jo aapki learning ko next level pe le jaayegi.
Ab isse aap chahe "meditation" bolo ya "mind hack", par kaam kaafi solid hai.
Agar aap is channel pe naye ho ya regularly dekhte ho — ho sakta hai koi design seekhna chahta ho, koi coding, koi cloud ya data science — learning goals sabke alag-alag hain, lekin ek cheez common hai — focus aur mindset.
Dekho teacher alag ho sakte hain, tools alag ho sakte hain, lekin learning ka mechanism mostly same hi hota hai.
Output tabhi aata hai jab input strong ho — toh aaj ka video thoda practical bhi hai aur thoda thought-provoking bhi
Dekho yaar, aajkal market mein itne roadmap ban gaye hain ki dimaag ka screw tight ho gaya hai—“Python matlab Data Science”, “Machine Learning”, “AI”… aur bas.
Par sach ye hai ki web dev mein bhi Python kaafi strong hai.

Ho sakta hai aapko na pata ho, but kaafi bade-bade infra Python pe run karte hain—pip ecosystem se.

Toh iss video mein aapko dikhega ki Python web dev mein kitna smooth, fast aur developer-friendly hai.

Aur ek cheez clear kar doon—ye bilkul bhi nahi keh raha ki JavaScript khatam ho gaya ya JS se web dev nahi hota.
Bilkul hota hai! Par market conditions aajkal aesi hain ki agar aap sirf ek language pe chipke ho—jaise “bas mujhe JavaScript aata hai”—toh wo limitation ho sakta hai.

Toh iss video ko ek fresh nazariye se dekho—ek new perspective se.

Toh chalo, ab screen share karte hain.

BTW, iss video mein main ek package use kar raha hoon—uvicorn. Ye Rust mein likha gaya hai, kaafi naya hai. Aapko deep mein jaane ki zarurat nahi—just FYI.

Sabse pehle VS Code open karte hain.
Aur ek chhoti si file drag & drop karte hain—ek Python project folder.

Python mein pip install waale concept hoti hai—just like npm install in JavaScript.
Aur pip packages ko isolate karne ke liye hum banate hain virtual environment—venv.

Jo bhi install karoge, wo sirf ussi virtual env mein hoga, system level pe kuch nahi.

Activate karne ke liye:
source .venv/bin/activate

Samjho ki ab hum ek chhoti si virtual machine ke andar kaam kar rahe hain.

Ab chalo fastapi install karte hain.
FastAPI ek awesome web framework hai Python ke liye—express ka Python version samajh lo.

Mainne FastAPI ke creator ke saath ek podcast bhi kiya tha—amazing guy!

Uske baad, uvicorn install karte hain—ye hota hai Python ka ASGI server. Pronounce karte hain: "you-vee-corn" 😄

Itna kaafi hai shuru karne ke liye.
Ab ek file banate hain—app.py. Jaise JS mein app.js hoti hai, same concept.
Ab likhna start karte hain Python code
Dekho syntax thoda different hai JS se, but basic concept same hai—jaise Express mein app banate the, waise hi yahan bhi FastAPI() se bana liya.`,

About: ` 
My Name is Hitesh Choudhary and I am a teacher by profession. I teach coding to various level of students, right from beginners to folks who are already writing great softwares. I have been teaching on for more than 10 years now and it is my passion to teach people coding. It's a great feeling when you teach someone and they get a job or build something on their own. Before you ask, all buttons on this website are inspired by Windows 7.
In past, I have worked with many companies and on various roles such as Cyber Security related roles, iOS developer, Tech consultant, Backend Developer, Content Creator, CTO . I have done my fair share of startup too, my last Startup was LearnCodeOnline where we served 350,000+ user with various courses and best part was that we are able to offer these courses are pricing of 299-399 INR, crazy right 😱? But that chapter of life is over and I am no longer incharge of that platform.
I think we have already complicated the front end too much, so I am opting for a simpler solution for my home page and this is one of the fastest web page on the internet.
Abhi mai Apna Cohort Launch kiya hai hai jaha pe hum web development,Gen Ai ,Data Science ke courses Launch kiya Agr,aapko bhi padna ho toh aap use jarur join kariye wha hum community me laerning krte hai aur bahot effieciently hum seekhte hai.
I am also a big fan of open source and I have contributed to many open source projects. I am also a big fan of Linux and I use it for my daily work.
